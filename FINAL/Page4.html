       <p> In the 16th and 17th centuries, European explorers began to arrive in the Lenape lands. Displacement soon followed. In 1626, the Lenape "sold" Manhattan land to Peter Minuit, a Dutch, for $24. For many years, the enduring story was that the settlers secured a fascinating deal. In truth, we learned in subsequent inquiry that it was a misunderstanding. Native Americans did not understand what selling land was because, in their culture, people don't own land that belongs to everyone. You share it. The Dutch did not care to contribute and build a stronger community but to take it away! They claimed the land for themself. Understanding history has consequences; getting the stories right or wrong creates today's consciousness. What we know builds our national identity, ethnic pride, and respectful relationships with others to build a better future for everyone. </p>
