       <p>The Lenape (Lenapehoking) people, also known as the Delaware Indians, were the original inhabitants of Manhattan and the surrounding areas. Indigenous people, primarily in the Western Hemisphere, were organized into hundreds of tribes or nations for 13,000 years before European settlers arrived. Natives to that Land were brutally and violently displaced under 400 years of Dutch and European colonialism. Many institutions acknowledge this pain, with a simple statement before public gatherings: 
 "The Land on which this building stands is part of the ancient homeland and traditional territory of the Lenape people. We respect the Lenape people's past, present, and future and their continuing presence in the homeland and throughout the diaspora."</p>
