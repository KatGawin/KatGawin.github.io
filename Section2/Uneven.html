       <h1>November is National American Indian Heritage Month </h1>

       <p>Throughout November the nation pauses to reflect on the history, culture and contributions of Indigenous people. A connecting thread has been a tragedy. The Indigenous people of the Americas were marginalized, brutalized and oppressed for centuries, and yet have maintained their traditions, language, and beliefs despite the odds.</p>
