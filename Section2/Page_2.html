       <p>November also marks the harvest season in many indigenous cultures.
        It is a time when native communities come together to celebrate their 
        connection to the land, express gratitude for nature's abundance, 
        honor traditional agricultural practices, and for families to connect.
       Recognizing Indigenous Peoples Month during this time allows for the inclusion
        of cultural activities and events related to their traditions and folklore.
All of that provides a platform for education, dialogue,
 and reflection on the ongoing struggles for indigenous rights,
  land sovereignty, and cultural preservation.
